## How to run the full web
First of all, you have to be awere about the fact that most browsers like Chrome avoid the execution of multiple data paths from the same websocket.

So, if you plan to run the backend and frontend of the web on the same localHost you must have installed a extension to allow so.

You can use for example 

[Allow CORS on chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)

In any of the apps you install I recommend you to check all the posible permitions.

## Run API

Before trying to run the web on a browser you have to run the API used by it.
You can do so opening in terminal the folder ./APIrest and run the following commands.

**npm install**

To install all the necessary depedencies.

**npm run dev**

To run the actual API, left the console window open and start working on another to run the front.

## Run React

As in the last case open the terminal of the folder ./powerweb and run the following commands.

**npm install**

To install all the necessary depedencies.

**npm run start**

To run the web in your localhost. Don't worry about the ports, the API is set at 6969 and React is set on 3000
